* A dataset of 300 images of Circles and Squares with varying color combination in each image are downloaded from an external source and used.<br>

* Different types of ML algorithms are deployed in order to compare their performance<br>
Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost, Na√Øve Bayes, Linear SVM, RBF SVM, Decision Tree,<br>
Random Forest.<br>

* High accuracy of image classification was found.<br>
 
* Can be concluded that for the provided dataset Nearest Neighbors was outperforming all<br>
the other classifiers.
